    The three lines of code that are pointed to by this finding are used to add attribute
    values to SOAPElements within the SOAPHeader. These values, while not explicitly
    used by any subsequent instruction, are used in the generation of the SOAPMessage
    that is eventually sent to E&E as a request and are therefore should not be
    considered dead.

  <!--
    Line 84 of ConnectionProvider opens a url connection from the ee.endpoint.url in properties.
    To prevent Server Side Request forgery, the code checks the url protocol is HTTPS (E&E
    uses one way TLS) and that the request address is not local. If the url fails either of
    these checks, the connection is never made and the request fails.
